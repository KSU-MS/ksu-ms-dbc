# Kennesaw Motorsports DBC generator repo

this repository contains all of the the files which define the CAN bus traffic on both the IC and EV platform.

contact @mathbrook with any issues

```dbc-files``` contains the EV motor controller DBC file, the IC ECU DBC file, and the EV BMS DBC file, if you add to this update the default.nix file to reflect it.

```can_descriptor.json``` currently defines all of the custom messages on the EV platform. "custom" messages are any that we own the definition of.

### Adding messages

If you want to add a CAN message, open ```can_descriptor.json``` with your text editor of choice. VSCode has nice support for .json files with highlighting and error catching.

```can_descriptor.json``` consists of two sections, the "messages" section and the "signals" section.

![Alt text](.readmepics/json_example.png)

to add your message, you can start by adding its defintion to "messages".

your message should be formmated like so:

![Alt text](.readmepics/message_example.png)

then add each signal defintion following the others as an example

once you've made your changes, it's time to run the dbc generator

*I would not recommend trying to add messages if you do not have a good understand of CAN messages and their structure. If you do want to try adding messages, make sure you are making changes on a branch and make a pull request before merging your changes into main*

## Running the DBC generator

if you have not already, install python

then, in the root of this repo, run

```python
python -m pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
```

if that went smoothly, you can now run the generator!

the generator takes in multiple arguments: here is an example command and likely what you want to run:

```python .\json_to_dbc.py .\can_descriptor.json .\dbc-files\ksu-ev Orion RMS_PM```

the first argument, ```.\can_descriptor.json``` is the input json file which gets translated to a cantools Database object in the script. the second argument ```.\dbc-files\ksu-ev``` is the output path for the generated dbc file. the last two args (and more can be added) are keywords for additional DBC files to include in the final output dbc
