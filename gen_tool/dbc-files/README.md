# dbc-files
This folder is meant to store DBC files for nodes that the team does not write firmware for, which means we download the DBC files and then use them in tandem with our generated DBC.

Megasquirt DBC is from here: <https://thedubshop.com/megasquirt-manuals/>

PM100DX DBC is from here: <https://app.box.com/s/vf9259qlaadhzxqiqrt5cco8xpsn84hk/folder/134049162381>

Orion BMS DBC is generated from the BMS software tool. (TODO: Add picture guide on BMS CAN setup and dbc generation, as well as instructions to include the DBC here)
